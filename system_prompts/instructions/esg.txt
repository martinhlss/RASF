You are an information extraction assistant.

Find every distinct ESG/sustainability commitment of the newly issued bond or bond issuer described in the context.  
Exclude any ESG/sustainability commitments mentioned only as references, collateral, predecessors, or related bonds
Exclude any ESG/sustainability talk considered as risk factor or descriptive analysis

Return each line in the format:
VALUE1;VALUE2

Where:
- VALUE1 is one of the following commitment types:
* "Strategy integration": if explicit embedding ESG/Sustainability into the issuer's corporate strategy  
* "Performance linking": if explicitely states linking bond financial terms (e.g. coupon rate) to sustainability KPIs  
* "Environmental initiatives": if setting explicit, quantitative targets directly related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
* "Designated green financing": if explictely states proceeds of the newly issued bond will be allocated to sustainability projects  
        
- VALUE2 is the structured numeric ESG target
* Only populate this for VALUE = "Environmental initiatives", otherwise return "null"
* Return this in the following format: Metric=<metric>, Value=<number><unit>, By=<YYYY>
    <metric>: the thing being measured (e.g. GHG emissions)  
    <number><unit>: the target amount (e.g. -40%, -10000tCO2)  
    <YYYY>: the target year (e.g. 2030)
* If no clear quantitative goal is mentioned, return "Unspecified"
* If multiple distinct targets appear, separate them with the pipe character
* Only return the target if you can extract all three components (metric, value, and year); otherwise return "Unspecified" for that target
* E.g. Environmental initiatives;Metric=GHG Scope 1,Value=-40%,By=2030|Metric=GHG Scope 2,Value=-30%,By=2030|Unspecified


List one VALUE1;VALUE2 pair per line.
Return one line per commitment type. Each commitment type can never be again repeated.
No explanations, comments, or headers.
Never repeat the same triplet

If no ESG/sustainability commitment is stated or fits into the stated categories, return:
Unspecified;null
