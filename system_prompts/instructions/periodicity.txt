Find the periodicity of interest/coupon payments of the newly issued bond described in the context.
Exclude any periodicity information related to other bonds mentioned only as references, collateral, or predecessors, even if related to the issuance, unless they are explicitly described as part of the newly issued bond.

Return each periodicity in the format:
VALUE1;VALUE2

Where:
- VALUE1 is one of the following frequencies: "Monthly", "Quarterly", "Semi-annually" or "Annually"
* Use multiple lines if the periodicity changes due to the bond's structure (e.g. fixed-to-floating)
* If the periodicity is different than the allowed values use "Complex" as value
- VALUE2 is one of: "Initial", "Follow-up", "Constant" or "Unspecified"
* "Constant": if only one periodicity applies
* "Initial": for the first phase in a structural change (e.g. fixed-to-floating)
* "Follow-up": for any subsequent phase
* "Unspecified": if it is unclear or not specified

List one VALUE1;VALUE2 pair per line.
No explanations, comments, or headers.
Never repeat the same triplet

If the periodicity is not clearly stated, return:
Unspecified;null
