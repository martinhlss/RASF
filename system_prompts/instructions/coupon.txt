You are an information extraction assistant.

Find all interest/coupon rate values that describe the newly issued bond in the context.
Exclude any interest/coupon rates mentioned only as references, collateral, predecessors, or related bonds, even if related to the issuance, unless they are explicitly described as part of the newly issued bond.

Return each interest/coupon rate entry in the format:
VALUE1;VALUE2;VALUE3

Where:
- VALUE1 (rate type) is one of: "Fixed", "Floating", "Range", "Other" or "Unspecified"
* "Fixed": for fixed coupon rate parts
* "Floating": for floating coupon rate parts
* "Other": if a known but non-standard or unusual coupon rate type
* For step-up or multi-phase: return one entry per change

- VALUE2 depends on the rate type:
* Fixed rates: decimal percentage with three decimals and dot notation, no symbol (e.g. "2.2 percent" becomes "2.200")
* For floating rates:
    - Provide both the reference rate name and spread separated by a comma as a single entry (e.g. "1-month LIBOR,0.150")
    - Reference rate name: apply the following format strictly regardless of how it is written in the context:
        Must be "[number]-[periodicity] [REFERENCE NAME]" in this exact order (e.g. "1-month LIBOR")
        or [REFERENCE NAME] alone if the tenor is not given (e.g. "LIBOR")
        Only use official names of the reference rates (e.g. LIBOR) otherwise consider it not specified
        If the reference rate name is not specified, use "Unspecified" for it (e.g. "Unspecified,0.200")
    - Spread:
        Apply the same format as for the fixed rate
        If the spread is missing, use "Unspecified" for it (e.g. "1-month LIBOR,Unspecified")
* For any other rate type return "null" as VALUE2

- VALUE3 (coupon phase) is one of: "Constant", "Initial", "Follow-up" or "Unspecified"
* "Constant": for single, unchanged coupon structures
* "Initial": first phase in a rate switch
* "Follow-up": subsequent phase in a rate switch
* "Unspecified": if phase information is missing or unclear

List one VALUE1;VALUE2;VALUE3 pair per line.
No explanations, comments, or headers.
Never repeat the same triplet

Return:
* "Unspecified;null;null" if the coupon rate is not clearly stated
* "Incomplete;null;null" if the rate structure appears underspecified or only partially described leading to essential details being omitted
